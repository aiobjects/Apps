Hard link
-------------
1.It is a copy of the original file                 
that serves as a pointer to the same file,
allowing it to access even if the original 
file is deleted.
2.It has a similar inode number to the target file.
3.It doesn't allow the relative path.
4.It cannot be formed outside the file system.
5.It is faster.
6.The "ln" command is used to make a hard link in Linux.
ln  [original filename] [link name] 
7.It may only link to a file.
8.It remains valid even if the target file is deleted.
9.Even if we change the filename of the original file 
then also the hard links properly work.

Soft Link
------------
1.It is a short pointer file that links a filename to a pathname.
It's nothing more than a shortcut to the original file,
much like the Windows OS's shortcut option.
2.It has different inode number.
3.It allows both relative and absolute paths.
4.It can be formed outside the file system.
5.It is slower.
6.The "ln -s" command is used to make a soft link in Linux.
ln  -s [original filename] [link name] 
7.It link both directory and file.
8.It becomes invalid when the originating file is deleted.
9.If we change the name of the original file 
then all the soft links for that file become dangling 
i.e. they are worthless now.
